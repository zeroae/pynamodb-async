"""
Async halves of operations that differ between the sync and async APIs.

Helpers for operations whose synchronous and asynchronous forms cannot be derived
from one another by rewriting keywords (sleeping, gathering, list building). This is
the only module in this package allowed to import asyncio.

`alist` is async-only: the generator rewrites `_compat.alist(` to `list(`.
